VIRTUAL vs REAL STORAGE (IT)
While the real storage it reffers to the space avaible in owned hard disks, ssds, optical drives
(like CDs, DVDs, etc), pendrives, smartphones, etc; the concept "virtual storage" its oriented
to the Cloud services, like Google Drive, OneDrive, MEGA, etc.

VIRTUAL vs PHYSICAL MEMORY (IT)
The physical -or real- memory in a computer it's determinated for the installed memory stick.
Example: four gigs of RAM DDR3.
Otherwise, the virtual memory seems unlimited. Why? The "virtual" memory can take space from
your hard disk or another storage drive avaible on your computer if you don't have enought
memory to run an application. The virtual memory is much slower than a real memory stick.
While a DDR3-1600MHz can handle up to 12800 megabytes per second, a normal SATA hard disk is
designed to handle a very low speed (70~100 MB/s). Since the virtual memory uses hard disk
space, you know how slow can be a PC -for example- with 2GB and Windows OS.

In the other hand, virtual memory it's necesary for PCs with 6GB or less RAM because thanks
to this technology the PC can handle programs wich excess the physical memory without system
crashes.
